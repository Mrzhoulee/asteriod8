# JARVIS HUD

An always-on-top, Claude-powered multi-agent assistant for macOS. JARVIS is your
chief of staff: it delegates to specialists, controls your Mac, posts to social,
schedules calls, checks analytics, and talks to any web API — all from a dark HUD
overlay that lives on your dock and in your menu bar.

## Agents

| Agent  | Role             | Accent |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| JARVIS | Center brain / orchestrator (has all the tools) | cyan |
| Hannah | Marketing & copywriting | pink |
| Marcus | Development & debugging | green |
| Rob    | Customer success & comms | amber |

These are just the defaults. Open **Customize (⌘,) → "AI model & team"** to rename
any teammate, change their role, or rewrite their job (system prompt) — and to pick
the Claude model that powers everyone (Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5). Changes
save to `personas.json` and apply to your next message; "Reset" restores a default.

## What JARVIS can do

- **Your computer** — `run_command` runs any shell command; `run_applescript`
  drives any Mac app (Messages, Mail, Calendar, Music, Finder, Safari/Chrome,
  System Events UI automation); `control_mac` does quick actions (screenshot,
  notify, open app, set volume, clipboard).
- **Communications** — `send_email` (with attachments), `open_url`.
- **Social** — `post_social` to X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads, Reddit, etc.
- **Scheduling** — `schedule_event` adds calls to Calendar and generates `.ics`
  invites you can email to attendees.
- **The web / analytics** — `web_request` calls any REST API with a configured
  secret (Stripe, Google Analytics, GitHub, …).
- **Files** — `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`.
- **Delegation** — hands specialist work to Hannah, Marcus, or Rob.

## Safety model — "do anything", with a human in the loop

The agent reads untrusted content (emails, web pages), so destructive actions are
gated rather than blindly executed:

- **Safe** commands run automatically.
- **Dangerous** ones (`rm`, `sudo`, `chmod`, `git push`, file writes, system
  AppleScripts, sending email) pop a **confirmation dialog** showing the exact
  action — you approve before anything happens.
- **Catastrophic** ones (`rm -rf /`, disk formatting, fork bombs, force-push) show
  a stern warning that defaults to *Cancel*.

Nothing is impossible, but you always see destructive actions before they run —
which also defeats prompt-injection. Tell JARVIS "just send it" / include "just
send it" to skip confirmation for a turn.

## Setup

```bash
cd jarvis-hud
cp .env.example .env     # add your keys (see below)
npm install
npm start
```

### Required keys (`.env`)

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — powers every agent (default model: `claude-opus-4-8`;
  switch it live in Customize → "AI model & team", or set `JARVIS_MODEL`)
- `GROQ_API_KEY` — voice input (Whisper)
- Email: `GMAIL_USER` + `GMAIL_PASS` (app password) **or** `SMTP_*`

### Optional

- `SOCIAL_WEBHOOK_URL` — a Zapier/Make/Buffer hook for one-call multi-platform
  posting (otherwise JARVIS opens a pre-filled compose window).
- `X_BEARER_TOKEN` — direct posting to X.
- `WEB_AUTH_<NAME>` — Authorization header values for `web_request`
  (e.g. `WEB_AUTH_STRIPE=Bearer sk_live_…`), referenced by name so the model
  never sees the raw secret.

## Build a real dock app (`.app` / `.dmg`)

```bash
npm run icon     # generates build/icon.png + build/icon.icns (macOS)
npm run dist     # builds dist/JARVIS-*.dmg and a .app via electron-builder
```

Open the `.dmg`, drag **JARVIS** to `/Applications`, and launch it — it'll appear
on your dock and in the menu bar. For a packaged app, put your `.env` in the
app's data dir: `~/Library/Application Support/JARVIS/.env`.

> macOS will ask for **Accessibility**, **Automation**, **Screen Recording**, and
> **Microphone** permissions the first time JARVIS uses them — grant them in
> System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Usage

- Type or hold 🎤 to talk. `Enter` sends.
- **⌘⇧J** toggles the HUD anywhere. The menu-bar icon does too.
- 🔊 toggles spoken replies (macOS `say`).
- Memory persists the last 20 exchanges (`memory/context.json` in dev, app data
  dir when packaged); the last 10 are passed back to Claude as context.
